  <h1>My name is Amelie Caroline Mbende.</h1>
  <p>I am a business analytics student. 
I find it very interesting how numbers are used to solve real-life problems. 
I like challenges and I don't hesitate to go for something new. 
After school and my part-time job, I enjoy spending time with my family.</p>
