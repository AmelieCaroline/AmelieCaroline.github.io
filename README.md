Steps I took to clone the repository onto my local machine
After I have created my repository on my git online account
I opened my git desktop
I clicked on current repository (because I had already created repositories from the LinkedIn videos course material)
then "Add"
then "clone repository"
in the list of repositories, I choose the one I wanted to clone
then I choose the location of that repository in my File Explorer
then I clicked on "clone"
